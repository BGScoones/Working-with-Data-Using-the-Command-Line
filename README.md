## Working-with-Data-Using-the-Command-Line

My first project completed using only the command line. In this project, I analyse a dataset containing data on submissions to Hacker News. I use the command line to combine a few files and to write code that will:
 - Read in a csv file and turn it into a DataFrame, adding column headings to the columns
 - Concatenate strings and perform a word count, returning the n most popular words in the given strings
 - Find which websites submitted the most posts
 - Find which hour of the day submissions are most common
